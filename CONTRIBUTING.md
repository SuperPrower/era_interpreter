## Code Style

Project attempts to follow [Linux Kernel Coding Style](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html) with few exceptions. It's not directly enforced, but please restrain from proposing changes with blatant

Exceptions to the style are:

- Enclose body of if, for and other statements in curly brackets even if there is only one statement

Be sure to comment your code with doxygen-compatible commentaries.
